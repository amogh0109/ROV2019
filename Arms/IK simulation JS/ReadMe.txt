I have included the FABRIK paper as well as the initial approach I took to implement the algorithm mentioned in the paper itself. Furthermore, I tried to implement the rotational constraints but that was interrupted and was put on hold since then.

Workflow for using the code:
+ The code consists of 2 parts the HTML page layout.
- Currently the page layout has no significance and you can ignore it for the sake of simplicity.
- Whatever things you feel are redundent and are not required in future, remove that!

+ Javascript code file.
- The code has been written for the 'Canvas element'(HTML tag) and a drawcall once per frame.
- Animations are taken care of by clearing the canvas first then drawing a new frame on it.
